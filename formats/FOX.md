# FOX - Furcadia Objects eXtended Format
## Overview
FOX format is the latest (at least at the time of writing) file format used to
represent graphics within Furcadia. It succeeds the [FSH](FSH.md)
and [FS2](FS2.md) formats and adds extra features that newer versions of
Furcadia are taking advantage of - on top of features offered by its former
formats:
* 32bit colors (including opacity)
* Animation support ("frames")
* Compression

## Format
The format itself is documented in [026_fox_format.pdf](../official/026_fox_format.pdf) -
please review that file for details.
