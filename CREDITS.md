While the FTR project has been a personal effort of mine over the decades,
it embodies in it a compilation of knowledge obtained from different sources
other than personal reverse-engineering: be it existing docs created by
Furcadians before me, official PDFs published by DEP, or simply information
shared with me in chats by fellow enthusiasts.

The following is a list of names of those who in some form contributed to this
project over its many iterations, and thanks to whom this project could reach
as far as it had.

* Cluracan
* Coopper Dragon
* Dia Sapphire
* Dreamless Dancer (aka: Dream Dancer)
* Ezoa
* Félix Wolf
* Hollyberry
* Juntalis
* Klass
* Kunnis
* Kylix
* Lochlann Scuirine
* Morpius
* Null Flux
* Radiant
* Reunion
* sanctimonious
* Treeki
* Xemberad
* xPi

This project started off as an adaptation of the
[RedI Furcadia Protocol (RFPv015)](_assets/rfp.html) page, and was updated over
the years - to the best of my abilities - to be in line with the current
version of Furcadia. This page gave me a significant boost and for that I am
forever thankful.
