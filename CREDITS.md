While the FTR project has been a personal effort of mine over the decades,
it embodies in it a compilation of knowledge obtained from different sources
other than personal reverse-engineering: be it existing docs created by
Furcadians before me, official PDFs published by DEP, or simply information
shared with me in chats by fellow enthusiasts.

The following is a list of names of those who in some form contributed to this
project over its many iterations, and thanks to whom this project could reach
as far as it had.

* Cluracan	
* Coopper Dragon	
* Dia Sapphire	
* Dreamless Dancer (aka: Dream Dancer)
* Ezoa
* FÃ©lix Wolf
* Hollyberry	
* Juntalis	
* Klass	
* Kunnis
* Kylix	
* Morpius	
* Null Flux	
* Radiant
* Reunion	
* sanctimonious
* Treeki	
* Xemberad	
* xPi

This project started off as an adaptation of the
[RedI Furcadia Protocol (RFPv015)](_assets/rfp.html) page, and was updated over
the years - to the best of my abilities - to be in line with the current
version of Furcadia. This page gave me a significant boost and for that I am
forever thankful.
